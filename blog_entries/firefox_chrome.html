            1. Firefox is open source, and it's not owned by Google. That is, in my opinion, already a good reason to switch. <br>
            2. Firefox is more customizable than Chrome. There's a huge variety of themes and user-made CSS stylesheets for it! Personally, I like <a href="https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme">the GNOME one</a>.<br>
            3. Firefox hasn't got a built-in ad-blocker, however it does have <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/introducing-total-cookie-protection-standard-mode?as=u&utm_source=inproduct">some tracking protection enabled by default</a> and an optional higher protection level. There are loads of privacy-oriented extensions in the Firefox extension store such as uBlock Origin and ClearURLs which I highly recommend.</a><br>
            4. Manifest V3 is a new feature that Google is planning to implement in Chrome. It will allow Google to track users even more than they already do. <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2020/09/23/google-chrome-extensions-are-going-to-be-crippled/">Here's a link to an article about it.</a> It will do it by limitting what extensions can do, knowing that Google is also an advertising company it isn't any surprising. Here are some articles about it: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening">EFF</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/">DDG</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf">and the Princeton university.</a><br>
            5. In my opinion, it's really annoying how Chrome keeps trying to make you log-in and use Google services. <br>
            6. <b>Containers!</b> They're very useful, you can use them to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time, for example to separate your work and personal accounts and it avoids tracking across said containers. I'd say it's one of the best Firefox features. <br>
            7. Firefox has a built-in screenshot tool, which you can activate using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S. <br>
            8. Firefox has a Picture in Picture feature that allows you to overlap a YouTube video on top of other windows. <br>
        </p>
        <b>Android</b> <br>
        <p>
            1. Firefox for Android <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-firefox-android">supports extensions</a>, unlike most other browsers. <br>
            2. As mentioned above, it's open source and not owned by Google. <br>
            3. The UI looks way better in my opinion with the bottom URL bar. <br>
        </p>
        <b>Cross-platform</b> <br>
        <p>
          1. Firefox sync, in my opinion, is integrated better and is also not as nagging as Chrome's. Another thing I really like about Firefox sync is how smooth sending tabs through my devices is.<br>
        </p> <br>
        Although this is a comparison with Chrome, some points still apply with Chromium.
