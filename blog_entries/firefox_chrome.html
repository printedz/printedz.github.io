            1. Firefox is open source, and it's not owned by Google. That is, in my opinion, already a good reason to switch. <br>
            2. Firefox is more customizable than Chrome. There's a huge variety of themes and user-made CSS stylesheets for it! Personally, I like <a href="https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme">the GNOME one</a>.<br>
            3. Firefox hasn't got a built-in ad-blocker, however it does have <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/introducing-total-cookie-protection-standard-mode?as=u&utm_source=inproduct">some tracking protection enabled by default</a> and an optional higher protection level. There are loads of privacy-oriented extensions in the Firefox extension store such as uBlock Origin and ClearURLs which I highly recommend.</a><br>
            4. Manifest V3 is a new feature that Google is planning to implement in Chrome. It will allow Google to track users even more than they already do. <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2020/09/23/google-chrome-extensions-are-going-to-be-crippled/">Here's a link to an article about it.</a> It will do it by limitting what extensions can do, knowing that Google is also an advertising company it isn't any surprising. Here are some articles about it: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening">EFF</a>, <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/biggest-tracker-networks/">DDG</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf">and the Princeton university.</a><br>
            5. In my opinion, it's really annoying how Chrome keeps trying to make you log-in and use Google services. <br>

        <b>Android</b> <br>
        <p>
            1. Firefox for Android <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-and-install-add-ons-firefox-android">supports extensions</a>, unlike most other browsers. <br>
            2. As mentioned above, it's open source and not owned by Google. <br>
            3. The UI looks way better in my opinion with the bottom URL bar. <br>
