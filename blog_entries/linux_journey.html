      however I think I've settled on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. I really like
      how it's stable (<a moz-do-not-send="true"

      distro with up-to-date packages<font size="-1">. <font size="+1">Here

    <font size="+1">E-mail client: SeaMonkey, I really like how well it
      integrates with the browser, and it has S/MIME support!<br>
      Instant messaging apps: Nheko, ArmCord, Konversations and Revolt<br>
      Desktop environment: KDE<br>
      <br>
      I've found the KDE ecosystem to perfectly suit my needs, some
      would argue it's not polished and it's unstable but I haven't had
      any issues with it. In fact, I've had more problems with GNOME
      apps.<br>
